This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR, and is configurable with the --prefix / --openssldir configuration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the mingw configuration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed in a Unix-like environment and the default prefix for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR should be '/usr/local'. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, find themselves looking at sub-directories of 'C:/usr/local', which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users to modify OpenSSL's default configuration, insert CA certificates, modify (or even replace) existing engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, '/usr/local/ssl' is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own --prefix. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c).

In that scenario, if the handshake fails then a fatal error will be returned in the initial function call. If SSL_read()/SSL_write() is subsequently called by the application for the same SSL object then it will succeed and the data is passed without being decrypted/encrypted directly from the SSL/TLS record layer.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue.

Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2r (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2q)."}}, "hash": 1666179842, "port": 80, "transport": "tcp", "version": "2.4.41", "cloud": {"region": "us-east-1", "service": "AMAZON", "provider": "Amazon"}, "ip": 65290652, "location": {"city": "Ashburn", "region_code": "VA", "area_code": null, "longitude": -77.48749, "country_code3": null, "country_name": "United States", "postal_code": null, "dma_code": null, "country_code": "US", "latitude": 39.04372}, "product": "Apache httpd", "http": {"robots_hash": -637318611, "redirects": [], "securitytxt": null, "title": null, "sitemap_hash": null, "robots": "User-agent: *\nDisallow: /wp-admin/\nAllow: /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php\n", "server": "Apache/2.4.41 () OpenSSL/1.0.2k-fips PHP/7.4.4", "host": "3.228.65.156", "html": "", "location": "/", "html_hash": 0, "sitemap": null, "securitytxt_hash": null}, "tags": ["cloud"], "timestamp": "2021-11-07T17:56:04.995253", "hostnames": ["ec2-3-228-65-156.compute-1.amazonaws.com"], "org": "Amazon Data Services NoVa", "data": "HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\r\nDate: Sun, 07 Nov 2021 17:56:03 GMT\r\nServer: Apache/2.4.41 () OpenSSL/1.0.2k-fips PHP/7.4.4\r\nUpgrade: h2,h2c\r\nConnection: Upgrade, close\r\nX-Powered-By: PHP/7.4.4\r\nSet-Cookie: PHPSESSID=elfv5htur98k297d1k1013m45r; path=/\r\nExpires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT\r\nCache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate\r\nPragma: no-cache\r\nSet-Cookie: ppwp_wp_session=38d2a21c710729bfb17d3ab1650d0a0b%7C%7C1636309563%7C%7C1636309203; expires=Sun, 07-Nov-2021 18:26:03 GMT; Max-Age=1800; path=/\r\nX-Pingback: http://academy.heflo.com/xmlrpc.php\r\nX-Redirect-By: WordPress\r\nLocation: https://academy.heflo.com/\r\nReferrer-Policy: \r\nContent-Length: 0\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\n\r\n", "asn": "AS14618", "cpe23": ["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.0.2k", "cpe:2.3:a:php:php:7.4.4", "cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server:2.4.41"], "info": "() OpenSSL/1.0.2k-fips PHP/7.4.4", "isp": "Amazon.com, Inc.", "cpe": ["cpe:/a:openssl:openssl:1.0.2k", "cpe:/a:php:php:7.4.4", "cpe:/a:apache:http_server:2.4.41"], "domains": ["amazonaws.com"], "ip_str": "3.228.65.156", "os": null, "_shodan": {"options": {}, "id": "88e53c94-26d3-4574-9e32-116d512d4e67", "module": "http", "crawler": "f84746de6c89bcf60f34a5f0aee149448facfc91"}}], "total": 1}
